# euler-rs

Solve Project Euler problems using Rust as an incentive to learn the language.

Self-enforced rules:

* Never ever cheat (I won't peek at other's solutions),
* Try and go the extra mile whenever possible.

Basically, I want to learn Rust. It takes precedence over solving Euler's problems. That means I won't take any shortcuts that may result in overly hackish and throwaway code. Instead I intend to build upon the language many constructs in order to create generic and elegant, reusable solutions wherever possible.
