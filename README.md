# euler-rs

Solve Project Euler problems using Rust as an incentive to learn the language.

Self-enforced rules:

* Never ever cheat (I won't peek at other's solutions),
* Try and go the extra mile whenever possible,
* Performance matters, efficient algorithms should be used.

As I wrote this a few years ago, the code may not take advantage of some of the recent stable features.

Most of the code is unit tested and benchmarked. Some problems have been solved using several approaches to get a handle on how to write fast Rust code.
